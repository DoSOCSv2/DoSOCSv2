dosocs2 is a command-line tool for managing SPDX 2.0 documents and data. It can
scan source code distributions to produce SPDX information, store that
information in a relational database, and extract it in a plain-text format
on request.

dosocs2 enables easy creation of a "bill of materials" for any software package,
and can even be used in the creation and continuous maintenance of an inventory
of all open-source software used in an organization.

[SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard format for communicating information
about the contents of a software package, including license and copyright
information. dosocs2 supports the SPDX 2.0 standard, released in May 2015.

dosocs2 is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible
changes until a 1.x.x release!

### Current deviations from SPDX 2.0 specification

* Exactly one package per document is required. (SPDX 2.0 allows zero or more
  packages per document.)
* Files in a document can only exist within a package. (SPDX 2.0 allows files
  to exist outside of a package.)
* Checksums are always assumed to be SHA-256. (SPDX 2.0 permits SHA-1, SHA-256,
  and MD5)
* A file may be an artifact of only one project.
* License expression syntax is not parsed; license expressions are interpreted as license
  names that are not on the SPDX license list.
* Deprecated fields from SPDX 1.2 (reviewer info and file dependencies) are not supported.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.7.x

Optional:
- PostgreSQL 8.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)

Python libraries:
- All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.


Installation
------------

### Step 1 - Download and install

[Grab the source tarball for the latest
release](https://github.com/ttgurney/dosocs2/releases) and use `pip` to install
it as a package. Replace `0.x.x` with the latest release version number.

I recommend doing this inside a Python
[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is not a requirement. If you are not inside a virtualenv you may have to run
`pip` as root (not recommended!).


    $ tar xf 0.x.x.tar.gz
    $ pip install ./DoSOCSv2-0.x.x

Then run the install script for the default license scanner:

    $ ./DoSOCSv2-0.x.x/scripts/install-nomos.sh

### Step 2 (Optional) - Change the default configuration

Not required, but strongly recommended, is to generate an initial config
file:

    $ dosocs2 newconfig
    dosocs2: wrote config file to /home/tom/.config/dosocs2/dosocs2.conf

The default config points to a SQLite database stored in your home directory.
For example, for user `tom`, this database would be created at
`/home/tom/.config/dosocs2/dosocs2.sqlite3`. If you like, you can open the
config file and change the `connection_uri` variable to use a different
location for the database.


### Step 3 (Optional) - Add PostgreSQL configuration

Follow this step if you want to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for the
SPDX database.

You will have to create the `spdx` (or whatever name you want) role and
database yourself.  I recommend setting a different password than the
one given...:

    $ sudo -u postgres psql
    psql (9.3.9)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# create role spdx with login password 'spdx';
    CREATE ROLE
    postgres=# create database spdx with owner spdx;
    CREATE DATABASE

Then change the `connection_uri` variable in your `dosocs2.conf`:

    # connection_uri = postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database
    connection_uri = postgresql://spdx:spdx@localhost:5432/spdx


### Step 4 - Database setup

Finally, to create all necessary tables and views in the database:

    $ dosocs2 dbinit

You only need to do this once. **This command will drop all
existing tables from your SPDX database, so be careful!**

Usage
-----

The simplest use case is scanning a package, generating a
document, and printing an SPDX document in one shot:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: package_id: 1
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 1
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: document_id: 1
    [... document output here ...]

Also works on directories:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot ./path/to/directory

The scan results and other collected metadata are saved in the database
so that subsequent document generations will be much faster.

To just scan a package and store its information in the database:

    $ dosocs2 scan package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 456

In the default configuration, if a scanner is not specified, only `nomos`
is run by default. It gathers license information, but is a bit slow.
One can use the `-s` option to explicitly specify which scanners to run:

    $ dosocs2 scan -s nomos_deep,dummy package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos_deep on package 456
    dosocs2: running dummy on package 456

After `dosocs2 scan`, no SPDX document has yet been created.
To create one in the database (specifying the package ID):

    $ dosocs2 generate 456
    dosocs2: (package_id 456): document_id: 123

Then, to compile and output the document in tag-value format:

    $ dosocs2 print 123
    [... document output here ...]

Use `dosocs2 --help` to get the full help text. The `doc` directory
here also provides more detailed information about how `dosocs2` works
and how to use it.


History
-------

dosocs2 owes its name and concept to the
[DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) tool created by Zac
McFarland, which in turn was spun off from the [do_spdx](https://github.com/ttgurney/yocto-spdx/blob/master/src/spdx.bbclass) plugin for Yocto
Project, created by Jake Cloyd and Liang Cao.

dosocs2 aims to fill the same role as DoSOCS, but with support for SPDX 2.x, a
larger feature set, and a more modular implementation, among other changes.

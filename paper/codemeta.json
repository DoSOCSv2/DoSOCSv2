It can scan source code distributions to produce SPDX information, store that information in a relational database, and extract it in a plain-text format on request. DoSOCS enables easy creation of a \"bill of materials\" for any software package, and can even be used in the creation and continuous maintenance of an inventory of all open-source software used in an organization.",

# Summary
DoSOCSv2 is a command-line tool for managing SPDX 2.0 documents and data. It can scan source code distributions to produce SPDX information, store that information in a relational database, and extract it in a plain-text format on request. DoSOCSv2 enables the creation of SPDX documents for any software package, and can even be used in the creation and continuous maintenance of an inventory of all open-source software used in an organization.
